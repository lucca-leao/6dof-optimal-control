# optimal-control
This repository contains experimental MATLAB simulations of complete pose control (6DoF) of a robot manipulator using optimal control techniques. A Nonlinear MPC controller is used to generate a control input sequence that is applied to the robot joints to regulate the final position and orientation.

One example trajectory can be seen in the video below:
